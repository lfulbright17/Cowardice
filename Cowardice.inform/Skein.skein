Your good friend Luigi has invited you to go camping with him over the weekend to Axe Creek, an abondoned camp site infamous for its reports of mysterious casualties and missing persons. Being a timid and not-so adventurous person, it took lots of convincing before you agreed to go. You decided that this could be your chance to prove to yourself that you&apos;re not a big baby. You can survive a single weekend in the woods, right?

Cowardice
An Interactive Fiction by Lee-Won Fulbright
Release 1 / Serial number 141027 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Campsite
The campsite is surrounded with greenery. In the center of the camp is a roaring fire. Luigi is lounging around the campsite. He seems to be carrying some kind of flat, wooden object. You should try talking to him first. 

 Your pitched tent is South. North is the Forest Clearing.

Reasons behind these murders as well as facts on the killer are unknown. To uncover these mysteries, I plan to contact the spirit of the murderer himself using my ouija board. Also known as the Witch Board, the Ouija Board is an ancient tool used to form a connection with the departed, first used by the Chinese in 1100 AD.

You read: &quot; Entry Two of Four. xx/xx/xxxx.  Night has fallen, and I am ready to open the board and begin communication with xxxxxxxx xxx. I am quite proud of my special Ouija board. It is unique in that you must knock three times on the board to open it. This insures that not just anyone can have easy access to the board, as using a ouija board is quite dangerous. After opening the board, I will place my hands on the planchette and ready myself both mentally and physically to encounter xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malevolent spirit. Anyone who&apos;s used a ouija board before knows that if the planchette moves to each of the four corners of the board, you have contacted an evil spirit. So, that&apos;s what I&apos;m keeping an eye out for while I&apos;m searching for the axe murderer&apos;s spirit.&quot;

You read: &quot; Entry Three of Four. xx/xx/xxxx.  I did it-- I reached the spirit of xxxxxxxx xxx. His spirit is unlike any I have come into contact with. It responds much faster, and with much greater intelligence than those of most entities. It is powerful, that much is apparent. I must remain wary of xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malicious intent; false flattery and lies are only to be expected from the likes of it. If anything begins to go wrong, I will simply exit the conversation by moving the planchette to the part of the board &quot;GOOD BYE&quot;, which should sever the connection between the spirit and myself. Let this be a reminder to myself and a warning to anyone reading this:  If the spirit should somehow possess an object/body, do NOT ATTEMPT TO KILL IT. This will only result in eminent death. Evil spirits are not to be reckoned with. My goal is to inquire about the final resting place of xxxxxxxx xxx, find the remains, and burn them. Hopefully, by doing this, the spirit will be put to rest.&quot;

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other.

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

 You enter the abandoned cabin.  The room has peeling walls and a rotten wooden floor. Both seem to be splattered with a dark stain. There is no furniture in the room, besides a single book lying in the middle of the floor. 

 North of this room is the Attic. East of here is an open door leading to what looks like a bedroom.  South is Forest Clearing.

I am the famous paranormal invesitgator, xxxx xxxxxxxx. I have come here with the intentions of contacting the spirit of the axe murderer, xxxxxxxx xxx, who died in these woods xx years ago. Reasons behind these murders as well as facts on the killer are unknown. To uncover these mysteries, I plan to contact the spirit of the murderer himself using my ouija board. Also known as the Witch Board, the Ouija Board is an ancient tool used to form a connection with the departed, first used by the Chinese in 1100 AD. Tomorrow night, here in the cabin, I will attempt to make spiritual contact through the board.&quot;

I am quite proud of my special Ouija board. It is unique in that you must knock three times on the board to open it. This insures that not just anyone can have easy access to the board, as using a ouija board is quite dangerous. After opening the board, I will place my hands on the planchette and ready myself both mentally and physically to encounter xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malevolent spirit. Anyone who&apos;s used a ouija board before knows that if the planchette moves to each of the four corners of the board, you have contacted an evil spirit. So, that&apos;s what I&apos;m keeping an eye out for while I&apos;m searching for the axe murderer&apos;s spirit.&quot;

It responds much faster, and with much greater intelligence than those of most entities. It is powerful, that much is apparent. I must remain wary of xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malicious intent; false flattery and lies are only to be expected from the likes of it. If anything begins to go wrong, I will simply exit the conversation by moving the planchette to the part of the board &quot;GOOD BYE&quot;, which should sever the connection between the spirit and myself. Let this be a reminder to myself and a warning to anyone reading this:  If the spirit should somehow possess an object/body, do NOT ATTEMPT TO KILL IT. This will only result in eminent death. Evil spirits are not to be reckoned with. My goal is to inquire about the final resting place of xxxxxxxx xxx, find the remains, and burn them. Hopefully, by doing this, the spirit will be put to rest.&quot;

 Luigi quietly comes up from behind you.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

It looks like the traditional Ouija Board, with the alphabet, numbers 0-9, &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; at the two top corners of the board. The planchette is fixed to the board in a way so that keeps it from falling off the board when used. Below the numbes, you read &quot;GOOD BYE&quot; in large letters. In the bottom hand corner of the board you read &quot;Property of xxxx xxxxxxxx, Paranormal Investigator&quot;. 

 You notice that Luigi comes up from behind you. 

 Luigi: Yo! You got the board open. Try asking the board about the spirit.

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

Campsite
The campsite is surrounded with greenery. In the center of the campsite a roaring camfire blazes. Luigi is lounging around the campsite. He seems to be carrying some kind of flat, wooden object. You should try talking to him first. 

 Your pitched tent is South. North is the Forest Clearing.
