You can survive a single weekend in the woods, right?

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

In the bottom hand corner of the board you read &quot;Property of xxxx xxxxxxxx, Paranormal Investigator&quot;. 

 Luigi quietly comes up from behind you. 

 Luigi: YO! Heh, scared you didn&apos;t I? You jumped about six feet. Oh, you got the board open! I guess I&apos;ll follow you around now that things are getting interesting.Try asking the board about the spirit.

 Luigi is now following you.

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. You can see that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

 The skeletal remains of the Paranormal Investigator slowly animates, rising to its feet. It looks as if it is being possessed, no doubt by the spirit of the axe murderer. With startling ease, it begins to move towards you with murderous intent. You need to make a decision, and fast! For the first time, you notice a scrap of paper on the floor beside you. Picking it up, you read &quot;Search the pond. There you will find the remains. You must burn the remains if you want to survive.&quot; Is this a dying message from the paranormal investigator?

 Luigi: What do we do?! You&apos;re not going to kill me, are you?! I say we chop down the skeleton!! Kill it before it kills us! 

You need to carefully (yet quickly, time and turns used now count. There is a clock in the upper right hand corner.) look at your surroundings and take note of your items. There is only one correct way out of this situation.

 Luigi: YO! Heh, scared you didn&apos;t I? You jumped about six feet. Oh, you got the board open! I guess I&apos;ll follow you around now that things are getting interesting.Try asking the board about the spirit.

 Luigi is now following you.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. You can see that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

 The planchette moves one final time. Your heart feels like it has stopped in your chest. The planchette spells &quot;Prove your bravery and kill your friend. Or you will both die&quot;. You hear the attic door slam behind you.

 The skeletal remains of the Paranormal Investigator slowly animates, rising to its feet. It looks as if it is being possessed, no doubt by the spirit of the axe murderer. With startling ease, it begins to move towards you with murderous intent. You need to make a decision, and fast! For the first time, you notice a scrap of paper on the floor beside you. Picking it up, you read &quot;Search the pond. There you will find the remains. You must burn the remains if you want to survive.&quot; Is this a dying message from the paranormal investigator?

 Luigi: What do we do?! You&apos;re not going to kill me, are you?! I say we chop down the skeleton!! Kill it before it kills us! 

You need to carefully (yet quickly) look at your surroundings and take note of your items. There is only one correct way out of this situation.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other.

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

 You enter the abandoned cabin.  The room has peeling walls and a rotten wooden floor. Both seem to be splattered with a dark stain. There is no furniture in the room, besides a single book lying in the middle of the floor. 

 North of this room is the Attic. East of here is an open door leading to what looks like a bedroom.  South is Forest Clearing.

I am the famous paranormal invesitgator, xxxx xxxxxxxx. I have come here with the intentions of contacting the spirit of the axe murderer, xxxxxxxx xxx, who died in these woods xx years ago. Reasons behind these murders as well as facts on the killer are unknown. To uncover these mysteries, I plan to contact the spirit of the murderer himself using my ouija board. Also known as the Witch Board, the Ouija Board is an ancient tool used to form a connection with the departed, first used by the Chinese in 1100 AD. Tomorrow night, here in the cabin, I will attempt to make spiritual contact through the board.&quot;

I am quite proud of my special Ouija board. It is unique in that you must knock three times on the board to open it. This insures that not just anyone can have easy access to the board, as using a ouija board is quite dangerous. After opening the board, I will place my hands on the planchette and ready myself both mentally and physically to encounter xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malevolent spirit. Anyone who&apos;s used a ouija board before knows that if the planchette moves to each of the four corners of the board, you have contacted an evil spirit.

You read: &quot; Entry Three of Four. xx/xx/xxxx.  I did it-- I reached the spirit of xxxxxxxx xxx. His spirit is unlike any I have come into contact with. It responds much faster, and with much greater intelligence than those of most entities. It is powerful, that much is apparent. I must remain wary of xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malicious intent; false flattery and lies are only to be expected from the likes of it. If anything begins to go wrong, I will simply exit the conversation by moving the planchette to the part of the board &quot;GOOD BYE&quot;, which should sever the connection between the spirit and myself. Let this be a reminder to myself and a warning to anyone reading this:  If the spirit should somehow possess an object/body, do NOT ATTEMPT TO KILL IT. This will only result in eminent death. Evil spirits are not to be reckoned with. My goal is to inquire about the final resting place of xxxxxxxx xxx, find the remains, and burn them. Hopefully, by doing this, the spirit will be put to rest.&quot;

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other.

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

 The skeletal remains of the Paranormal Investigator slowly animates, rising to its feet. It looks as if it is being possessed, no doubt by the spirit of the axe murderer. With startling ease, it begins to move towards you with murderous intent. You need to make a decision, and fast! For the first time, you notice a scrap of paper on the floor beside you. Picking it up, you read &quot;Search the pond. There you will find the remains. You must burn the remains if you want to survive.&quot; Is this a dying message from the paranormal investigator?

 Luigi: What do we do?! You&apos;re not going to kill me, are you?! I say we chop down the skeleton!! Kill it before it kills us! 

You need to carefully (yet quickly) look at your surroundings and take note of your items. There is only one correct way out of this situation.

However, the skeleton is swift to dodge your blow, and quickly overwhelms you. In a split second, you remember what the paranormal investigator had written in his book-- &quot;If the spirit should somehow possess an object/body, do NOT ATTEMPT TO KILL IT. This will only result in eminent death.&quot;

 In an attempt to renounce your cowardice, you and Luigi die a pitiful death.

Follow the investigator&apos;s instructions carefully, time is of the essence. You can hear the skeleton racing down the attic.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other. The trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields create a mirror image.

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

Luigi is with you.

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other.

I am the famous paranormal invesitgator, xxxx xxxxxxxx. I have come here with the intentions of contacting the spirit of the axe murderer, xxxxxxxx xxx, who died in these woods xx years ago. Reasons behind these murders as well as facts on the killer are unknown. To uncover these mysteries, I plan to contact the spirit of the murderer himself using my ouija board. Also known as the Witch Board, the Ouija Board is an ancient tool used to form a connection with the departed, first used by the Chinese in 1100 AD. Tomorrow night, here in the cabin, I will attempt to make spiritual contact through the board.&quot;

You read: &quot; Entry Two of Four. xx/xx/xxxx.  Night has fallen, and I am ready to open the board and begin communication with xxxxxxxx xxx. I am quite proud of my special Ouija board. It is unique in that you must knock three times on the board to open it. This insures that not just anyone can have easy access to the board, as using a ouija board is quite dangerous. After opening the board, I will place my hands on the planchette and ready myself both mentally and physically to encounter xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malevolent spirit. Anyone who&apos;s used a ouija board before knows that if the planchette moves to each of the four corners of the board, you have contacted an evil spirit. So, that&apos;s what I&apos;m keeping an eye out for while I&apos;m searching for the axe murderer&apos;s spirit.&quot;

You read: &quot; Entry Three of Four. xx/xx/xxxx.  I did it-- I reached the spirit of xxxxxxxx xxx. His spirit is unlike any I have come into contact with. It responds much faster, and with much greater intelligence than those of most entities. It is powerful, that much is apparent. I must remain wary of xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malicious intent; false flattery and lies are only to be expected from the likes of it. If anything begins to go wrong, I will simply exit the conversation by moving the planchette to the part of the board &quot;GOOD BYE&quot;, which should sever the connection between the spirit and myself. Let this be a reminder to myself and a warning to anyone reading this:  If the spirit should somehow possess an object/body, do NOT ATTEMPT TO KILL IT. This will only result in eminent death. Evil spirits are not to be reckoned with. My goal is to inquire about the final resting place of xxxxxxxx xxx, find the remains, and burn them. Hopefully, by doing this, the spirit will be put to rest.&quot;

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other.

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

 The skeletal remains of the Paranormal Investigator slowly animates, rising to its feet. It looks as if it is being possessed, no doubt by the spirit of the axe murderer. With startling ease, it begins to move towards you with murderous intent. You need to escape the Attic, and fast!

 Luigi: What do we do?! I say we chop down the skeleton!! Kill it before it kills us! 

You need to carefully (yet quickly) look at your surroundings and take note of your items. Figure out the best way out of this situation.

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. You can see that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The sounds of the approaching skeleton are getting louder. Hurry!

 You notice that Luigi comes up from behind you. 

 Luigi: Yo! You got the board open. Try asking the board about the spirit.

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other.

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

Reasons behind these murders as well as facts on the killer are unknown. To uncover these mysteries, I plan to contact the spirit of the murderer himself using my ouija board. Also known as the Witch Board, the Ouija Board is an ancient tool used to form a connection with the departed, first used by the Chinese in 1100 AD.

This insures that not just anyone can have easy access to the board, as using a ouija board is quite dangerous. After opening the board, I will place my hands on the planchette and ready myself both mentally and physically to encounter xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malevolent spirit. Anyone who&apos;s used a ouija board before knows that if the planchette moves to each of the four corners of the board, you have contacted an evil spirit.

I must remain wary of xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malicious intent; false flattery and lies are only to be expected from the likes of it. If anything begins to go wrong, I will simply exit the conversation by moving the planchette to the part of the board &quot;GOOD BYE&quot;, which should sever the connection between the spirit and myself. Let this be a reminder to myself and a warning to anyone reading this:  If the spirit should somehow possess an object/body, do NOT ATTEMPT TO KILL IT. This will only result in eminent death. Evil spirits are not to be reckoned with. My goal is to inquire about the final resting place of xxxxxxxx xxx, find the remains, and burn them.

However, the skeleton is swift to dodge your blow, and quickly overwhelms you. In a split second, you remember what the paranormal investigator had written in his book-- &quot;If the spirit should somehow possess an object/body, do NOT ATTEMPT TO KILL IT. This will only result in eminent death.&quot;

 In an attempt to renounce your cowardice, you and Luigi die a pitiful death.

You have made the brave, but intelligent decision. Now, you must save yourself and Luigi from the spirit of the axe murderer that possesses the skeleton of the paranormal investigator. Follow the investigator&apos;s instructions carefully, time is of the essence. You can hear the skeleton racing down the attic.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields are very similar, but don&apos;t quite mirror each other. The trees on the perimeter of the surrounding fields create a mirror image.

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see the cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

Luigi is with you.
