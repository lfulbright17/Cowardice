I have come up with my own game idea. In the beginning of the game, the player is spending the weekend camping with close friend in the woods. friend brings a ouija board, and after playing for a while, you summon what might be a malevolent spirit. Player wins the game after a boss battle with the spirit. 

puzzle 1: look in forrest for bathroom??? or food?? stumble upon cabin??? in cabin you find ouija board
puzzle 2:Read and follow instructions on board game to correctly summon spirit
puzzle 3: ask about the spirit who lives in the forest, and where its body lays in the camp site
puzzle 4: find correct tools to summon/dig up body/remains????

then boss battle w/spirit????


NPC is spirit.
