Your good friend Luigi has invited you to go camping with him over the weekend to Axe Creek, an abondoned camp site infamous for its reports of mysterious casualties and missing persons. Being a timid and not-so adventurous person, it took lots of convincing before you agreed to go. You decided that this could be your chance to prove to yourself that you&apos;re not a big baby. You can survive a single weekend in the woods, right?

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

It looks like the traditional Ouija Board, with the alphabet, numbers 0-9, &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; at the two top corners of the board. The planchette is fixed to the board in a way so that keeps it from falling off the board when used. Below the numbes, you read &quot;GOOD BYE&quot; in large letters. In the bottom hand corner of the board you read &quot;Property of xxxx xxxxxxxx, Paranormal Investigator&quot;. 

 You notice that Luigi comes up from behind you. 

 Luigi: Yo! You got the board open. Try asking the board about the spirit.

It responds much faster, and with much greater intelligence than those of most entities. It is powerful, that much is apparent. I must remain wary of xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malicious intent; false flattery and lies are only to be expected from the likes of it. If anything begins to go wrong, I will simply exit the conversation by moving the planchette to the part of the board &quot;GOOD BYE&quot;, which should sever the connection between the spirit and myself. My goal is to inquire about the final resting place of xxxxxxxx xxx, find the remains, and burn them. Hopefully, by doing this, the spirit will be put to rest.&quot;

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.
