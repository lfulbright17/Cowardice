Your good friend Luigi has invited you to go camping with him over the weekend to Axe Creek, an abondoned camp site infamous for its reports of mysterious casualties and missing persons. Being a timid and not-so adventurous person, it took lots of convincing before you agreed to go. You decided that this could be your chance to prove to yourself that you&apos;re not a big baby. You can survive a single weekend in the woods, right?

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

    <result xml:space="preserve">You read: &quot; Entry Two. xx/xx/xxxx.  Night has fallen, and I am ready to open the board and begin communication with xxxxxxxx xxx. I am quite proud of my special Ouija board. It is unique in that you must knock three times on the board to open it. This insures that not just anyone can have easy access to the board, as using a ouija board is quite dangerous. After opening the board, I will place my hands on the planchette and ready myself both mentally and physically to encounter xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malevolent spirit. Anyone who&apos;s used a ouija board before knows that if the planchette moves to each of the four corners of the board, you have contacted an evil spirit. So, that&apos;s what I&apos;m keeping an eye out for while I&apos;m searching for the axe murderer&apos;s spirit.&quot;

    <result xml:space="preserve">You read: &quot; Entry Three. xx/xx/xxxx.  I did it-- I reached the spirit of xxxxxxxx xxx. His spirit is unlike any I have come into contact with. It responds much faster, and with much greater intelligence than those of most entities. It is powerful, that much is apparent. I must remain wary of xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malicious intent; false flattery and lies are only to be expected from the likes of it. If anything begins to go wrong, I will simply exit the conversation by moving the planchette to the part of the board &quot;GOOD BYE&quot;, which should sever the connection between the spirit and myself. My goal is to inquire about the final resting place of xxxxxxxx xxx, find the remains, and burn them. Hopefully, by doing this, the spirit will be put to rest.&quot;

Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.
