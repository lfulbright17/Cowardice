Your good friend Luigi has invited you to go camping with him over the weekend to Axe Creek, an abondoned camp site infamous for its reports of mysterious casualties and missing persons. Being a timid and not-so adventurous person, it took lots of convincing before you agreed to go. You decided that this could be your chance to prove to yourself that you&apos;re not a big baby. You can survive a single weekend in the woods, right?

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

It responds much faster, and with much greater intelligence than those of most entities. It is powerful, that much is apparent. I must remain wary of xxxxxxxx xxx&apos;s malicious intent; false flattery and lies are only to be expected from the likes of it. If anything begins to go wrong, I will simply exit the conversation by moving the planchette to the part of the board &quot;GOOD BYE&quot;, which should sever the connection between the spirit and myself.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.

Forest Clearing
Here there is a lack of trees, giving a view of the stars. In the center of the clearing, there is an oddly symmetrical pond. Now that you look around, you realize that the trees on the perimeter of the clearing seem to mirror each other. 

 You can see two paths on either side of the clearing. West is Western Field, and East is Eastern Field. You can see a cabin up ahead. North is to the cabin&apos;s front door. The path South leads to the Campsite.

The perfect-circle pond is serene, and so clear that you can see the bottom. There seems to be nothing alive in the pond.
