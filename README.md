Cowardice
=========
  When I came up with the idea for my game, I really wanted to make a creepy horror game. I wanted to have creepy descriptions,
freaky NPCs, and even add in some chilling music. However, what I ended up coding was less creepy and more about the story of 
this poor character (the player) who is struggling to make the right decisions and to be less of a cowardly person. The ouija
board was fun to write about, though.
	The one time that I got majorly stuck was when our class was kind of late in the process of coding. I still didn’t know how 
to end my game, what kind of spirit the NPC would be (evil or not), or any major plot points. This caused my work flow to be 
very slow and dull, and I felt enormous pressure and stress because I had no idea what I was going to do. So, the only way I
was able to become unstuck was to take some time to sit down and map out all the different ways the story could go. I 
brainstormed, jotted down puzzle ideas, and played other games. I did everything I could to get my creative juices flowing, 
and when I did, I planned how the game would play out, which allowed me to progress in my coding. 
	 My first puzzle is a combination of people/sequence/logic puzzles. This is because the player must speak to the NPC to gain
information about what to do next, follow correct steps to complete the puzzle, and use the correct items based on 
logic/inferences.The player must listen to Luigi’s requests for something to drink, obtain the canteen, fill it up
(using logic to fill it up w/ pond water), and give it to him.
	My second puzzle is a combination of an information puzzle and a people puzzle. To solve the second puzzle, the player
learns about the background of the game as well as the characters through learning from another person. However, in this puzzle
the player gets this person's information from a book, not directly from the person himself. Using the knowledge/information 
gathered from reading the book, the player must supply the knocking password (kind of a code) to open the ouija board (knocking
3 times on the board). 
	The third puzzle in my game is a combo of a people puzzle, riddle, and logic puzzle. The player must talk to the board and 
ask it questions to receive crucial information. Then after listening to the riddle after a series of questions, the player
must use logic to solve the riddle, using items found in in the game, examining objects/scenery, as well as knowing the layout
of the game. The player must make a mirror image (told by board) by chopping down the oak tree in the Easter field, then 
retrieving the wooden key to open the attic door.
	The gameplay mechanics in my game are fairly simple, which I think improves the player’s experience. I used a basic 
conversation code for the NPCs (ask [person] about [text]), didn’t include any complicated verbs, and tried to include as many
synonyms as possible so the player is able to progress smoothly.
	From our class, Brennan beta tested my game. When Brennan tested my game, the code was still fairly incomplete, so most of his 
feedback was about adding in descriptions, synonyms, and more actions. Also, Brennan found a way to complete my game without even 
opening the ouija board (the biggest part of my game, basically). This greatly affected my game because I had to add in dozens
more lines of code to avoid loopholes and exceptions that players can make.
In return, I beta tested Brennan’s game. Like him for me, I offered my advice on different descriptions and actions to include in 
his game, as well as making directions much clearer.
	I am definitely most proud of my fourth puzzle. The player, after examining the name card of the skeleton of the paranormal 
investigator, becomes trapped in the attic with the spirit of the axe murderer, who possessed the skeleton to try to kill you and 
Luigi. The player must figure out, in a limited number of turns, the single correct way out of the attic, or face death. I think 
it’s the most exciting puzzle, because there’s a lot at stake, and it really requires the player to observe their surroundings
and inventory to make an educated decision. I think this is just one of the funner puzzles, and I can’t wait to have more people
try it out. It’s interesting to see what every person would try to do first when put in that situation.
	Next time, I think I would try to focus more on character development throughout the game to create a stronger and
more meaningful story.Because of somewhat of a time crunch, I feel like this game has little background and supporting details,
making it less memorable. I could also make my game a little scarier next time, too!
